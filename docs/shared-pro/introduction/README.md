# Introduction

CloudLinux OS Shared Hosting Pro was developed with shared hosting in mind. It’s a state-of-the-art operating system that gives shared hosting providers what they need: advanced automation, deep-look performance analytics, and centralized monitoring tools.

It includes additional tools to expand the functionality.

To activate the CloudLinux OS Shared Pro you have to purchase a Shared Pro license first, or upgrade the existing one from the [cln.cloudlinux.com](https://cln.cloudlinux.com) then activate a license on a server using the [same instructions](https://docs.cloudlinux.com/legacy/cloudlinux_installation/#license-activation) just with a new key.
