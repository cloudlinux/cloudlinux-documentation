### CloudLinux OS Solo Features
 
We've pre-installed a couple of useful features in our distribution. The complete list of supported features is available in the [table above](/solo/introduction/#cloudlinux-os-editions-comparison).

* **CloudLinux Manager**

  CloudLinux Manager is a plugin which allows you to control all the
  CloudLinux settings from an easy-to-use web UI integrated into your control panel. 
  
  The sub-modules you can find in CloudLinux Manager are Website Monitoring tool, PHP Slow Site analyzer, and X-Ray.

  [See more](/solo/manager/).

* **Website Monitoring tool**

  Website Monitoring tool is a tool that allows you to track your websites uptime 
  and receive notifications about problems with access.

  Website Monitoring tool can gather and display information regarding the slowest websites on the server, 
  notify by emails about errors happened on websites and send you daily website performance reports.

  [See more](/cloudlinuxos/lve_manager/#website-monitoring-tab).

* **PHP Slow Site analyzer**

  PHP Slow Site analyzer (SSA) is a tool that generates daily reports for the server administrator 
  with information about the top N slow PHP-based URLs for all domains.

  The Slow Site analyzer tracks all PHP-based requests and selects slow ones by specific rules.

  [See more](/cloudlinuxos/lve_manager/#php-slow-site-analyzer).

* **X-Ray**

  X-Ray is a tool developed for website performance monitoring and performance issues detection.

  X-Ray can gather and visualize information about top slowest system functions, external requests, 
  software modules and database queries of the clientâ€™s PHP website.
