Webmasters look at minification as a primary method of reducing website load times via the bandwidth they use.</p><p>Minification also reduces JS, CSS and HTML files. The goal is removing comments and extra spaces. It crunches variables that minimize code and ultimately reduces the file size.</p><p>After minification, the file still functions as it should. The difference is a reduction in bandwidth due to network requests.</p><p><strong>By combining CSS &amp; JS files, HTTP/1 does not allow multiple requests from the same TCP connection between a host server and a web browser.</strong></p><p>Putting CSS and JS files into their respective groups, makes requests for downloads from a browser safe and more efficient. The old way meant multiple connections that took up bandwidth.</p><p><strong>File (CSS &amp; JS) combining is not necessary for HTTP/2 (see https://webspeedtools.com/should-i-combine-css-js/)</strong></p><p>HTTP/2 introduced multiplexing. Now, the browser can send unlimited number of requests to the server, then download all files simultaneously with only one TCP connection.</p><p>Consequently, HTTP/2 takes care of multiple TCP connections and the waiting time before each download. In one sense, consolidating CSS and JS files might be unnecessary.</p><p>To verify which HTTP version is used for requests on your site, you can use https://tools.keycdn.com/http2-test</p><h4 id="css-files" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#css-files" aria-hidden="true">#</a> CSS Files</h4><p><strong>Minify CSS</strong></p><p>Minify CSS reduces file sizes by taking out white space and comments embedded in the code.</p><p><strong>Combine CSS</strong></p><p>Combine CSS reduces HTTP requests by merging all your files into one. Combine CSS is not recommended if your site uses HTTP/2.</p><p><strong>Excluded CSS Files</strong></p><p>To single out those CSS files that should not be minimized, list the URLs attached to the CSS files that should be excluded from minification and concatenation (one per line).</p><div class="warning custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">Caution!</p><p>Minification removes the domain from the URL.</p></div><p>To prevent that, use (. *).CSS wildcards to exclude all files in a specific location.</p><p>3rd Party: when excluding external CSS files, use the domain or the full URL path.</p><p><strong>Optimize CSS delivery (Critical Path CSS)</strong></p><p>Critical Path CSS eliminates render-blocking CSS on your website and improves browser page render performance. Your website will load much faster for your visitors.</p><div class="tip custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">Note</p><p>This feature can only be activated in the AccelerateWP hosting panel interface or in the SmartAdvice WordPress plugin.

It is not recommended for HTTP2.</p><p><strong>Load JavaScript deferred</strong></p><p>One major cause of slow web pages is a so-called blocking script: <a href="https://www.dummies.com/web-design-development/javascript/deferred-loading-with-javascript/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.dummies.com/web-design-development/javascript/deferred-loading-with-javascript/</a>.</p><p>Loading JavaScript called a blocking script blocks the webpage from loading.</p><p>Using the <code>defer</code> attribute alerts the browser not to wait for the script. Things will continue as usual per the build HTML and DOM processes. Quietly, the script rests in the background, then runs once the DOM is built.</p><p>So, the <code>Load JavaScript deferred</code> option adds to each script tag the <code>defer</code> attribute.</p><p><strong>Delay JavaScript Execution</strong></p><p>This option helps to decrease the page load time by delaying loading of all JavaScripts on the page. This option can be applied only for already cached pages, it is incompatible with the Combine JavaScripts files option.</p><h4 id="media" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#media" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Media</h4><p><strong>LazyLoad</strong></p><p>LazyLoad affects the page in the next way - if the user opens the page for the first loading there will be only first displayed (visible to user) images, others will be loaded if the user scrolls down.
